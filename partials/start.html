<h1>Welcome to Breakout!</h1>
<p>This is Information about the game was compile from the break out wiki, more information can be found at
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game)">Breakout Wiki</a>.
</p>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<p>Breakout begins with eight rows of bricks, with each two rows a different kinds of color. The color order from the
  bottom up is yellow, green, orange and red. Using a single ball, the player must knock down as many bricks as
  possible
  by using the walls and/or the paddle below to hit the ball against the bricks and eliminate them. If the player's
  paddle
  misses the ball's rebound, they will lose a turn. The player has three turns to try to clear two screens of bricks.
  Yellow bricks earn one point each, green bricks earn three points, orange bricks earn five points and the top-level
  red
  bricks score seven points each. The paddle shrinks to one-half its size after the ball has broken through the red
  row
  and hit the upper wall. Ball speed increases at specific intervals: after four hits, after twelve hits, and after
  making
  contact with the orange and red rows.

<p>
  The highest score achievable for one player is 896; this is done by eliminating two screens of bricks worth 448
  points
  per screen. Once the second screen of bricks is destroyed, the ball in play harmlessly bounces off empty walls until
  the
  player restarts the game, as no additional screens are provided. However, a secret way to score beyond the 896
  maximum
  is to play the game in two-player mode. If "Player One" completes the first screen on their third and last ball,
  then
  immediately and deliberately allows the ball to "drain", Player One's second screen is transferred to "Player Two"
  as a
  third screen, allowing Player Two to score a maximum of 1,344 points if they are adept enough to keep the third ball
  in
  play that long. Once the third screen is eliminated, the game is over.

  The original arcade cabinet of Breakout featured artwork that revealed the game's plot to be that of a prison
  escape.
  According to this release, the player is actually playing as one of a prison's inmates attempting to knock a ball
  and
  chain into a wall of their prison cell with a mallet. If the player successfully destroys the wall in-game, their
  inmate
  escapes with others following.</p>
